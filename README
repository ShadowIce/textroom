1. Introduction
---------------

TextRoom is a pretty basic full-screen text editor, heavily inspired
by similar text editors such as Q10, JDarkRoom and so on.

2. Requirements
---------------
TextRoom requires Qt library version >=4.3.2.
It *may* work with earlier versions of Qt (from 4.x family), but it was not
tested.

3. Installation
---------------
To compile TextRoom, you will need Qt4 developement packages
(usually named -devel- or -dev in some distros). Cd to the directory
this README file is. Compilation includes three steps:

qmake-qt4
make

and then, as root:

make install

"make install" copies the newly compiled "bin/textroom" to "/usr/local/bin".
You can change its path by editing textroom.pro

The program stores its preferences in ~/.config/textroom/TextRoom.conf
